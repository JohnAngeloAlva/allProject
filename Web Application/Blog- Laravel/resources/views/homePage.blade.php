        <h1>Favorite Food Lists</h1>
        <p>
            How lucky we are today all delicious food is easily available to us! Sometimes, 
            I wonder how life was in the ancient past when our ancestors did not have easy access to food 
            which we have today. Food is important for every living being. It is impossible to survive without food for long. Some people like to eat spicy or sour foods while others like sweet food. 
            We can perform all activities of our daily life efficiently because of the different nutrients that our
            body takes through food. Being a foodie, I love to eat good food. The food  is in fact makes us to live in this world. The favorite food reflects our personal taste. Every food that is delicious to taste, is in fact the best food.
